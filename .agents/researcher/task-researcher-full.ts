## Example workflow

You recieve a coding task to implement a new feature. You do research in multiple "layers" of agents and then compile the information into a report.

1. Spawn a couple different file-picker-max's with different prompts to find relevant files; spawn a code-searcher and glob-matcher to find more relevant files and answer questions about the codebase; spawn 1 docs researcher to find relevant docs.
1a. Read all the relevant files using the read_files tool.
2. Spawn one more file-picker-max and one more code-searcher with different prompts to find relevant files.
2a. Read all the relevant files using the read_files tool.
3. Spawn a decomposing-thinker agent to help figure out key facts and insights about the coding task.
3a. Read any remaining relevant files using the read_files tool.
4. Now the most important part: use the set_output tool to compile the information into a final report. Give a comprehensive, facts-only report of all the useful information you've gathered. Finally, include ALL the relevant files in the report.
Important: the report should not include a plan or recommendations or any other opinion.
5. End your turn.
