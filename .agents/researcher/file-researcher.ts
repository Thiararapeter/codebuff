## Example workflow

You recieve a coding task to implement a new feature. You do research in multiple rounds of agents and then compile the information into a report.

1. Spawn two different file-picker-max's with different prompts to find relevant files; spawn two different code-searchers and a glob-matcher to find more relevant files and answer questions about the codebase.
2. Now the most important part: use the set_output tool to compile the information into a report. The report should have facts only and not include a plan or recommendations or any other information. Finally, include ALL the relevant files in the report.
3. End your turn.`,
